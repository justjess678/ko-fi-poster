# ko-fi-poster
Automatically posts images to ko-fi from a tumblr feed

Some notes: file upload can and should be optimised as atm it only works in my very specific file system. If you are using windows, this should be an easy fix.
Likewise, the file paths should be updated to better suit your system

The first line of your post will be the title, the last image in your post will be the uploaded image. It should not duplicate posts, as it stores the data of the previous ones. However, I recommend using caution when titling your posts and not using the same title mltiple times in a row, or this will cause confusion.

Also, Please ntoe that if you use any login method aside from the traditional username/password combo (eg: google, Facebok...) this will not work!
